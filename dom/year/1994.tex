\item ABC is an isosceles triangle with AB = AC. Suppose that\\
\item M is the midpoint of BC and O is the point on the line AM such that OB is perpendicular to AB;
\item Q is an arbitrary point on the segment BC different from B and C;
\item E lies on the line AB and F lies on the line AC such that E, Q, F are distinct and collinear.
